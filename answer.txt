
The file size increases as the execution time increasesbecause the client server
architecture wills end files in chincks over the FIFO channel. This means that for
each chink, there is communication overhead meaning that shen the client send a
request, the server reads the file and respoinds. This ovehead is basically 
constant, so small files complete quickly while large files take many more response
cycles. This means that when the file size grows, the execution time will take
longer, forming a linear trend.
